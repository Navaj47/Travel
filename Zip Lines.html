         <p>A zip-line, zip line, zip-wire, or flying fox is a pulley suspended on a cable, usually made of stainless steel, mounted on a slope. It is designed to enable cargo or a person propelled by gravity to travel from the top to the bottom of the inclined cable by holding on to, or being attached to, the freely moving pulley. It has been described as essentially a Tyrolean traverse that engages gravity to assist its speed of movement. Its use is not confined to adventure sport, recreation, or tourism, although modern-day usage tends to favor those meanings.
<br><br>
         <b>Safety :</b>
<br><br>
There are certain precautions that can be taken. Riders are physically attached to the cable by a harness which attaches to a removable trolley. A helmet is required on almost all courses of any size. All zip-line cables have some degree of sag, so the proper tensioning of a cable is important and allows tuning the ride of a zip-line.
                    
<br><br>
<b>Longest :</b>
<br><br>
The world's longest zip-line as of 31 January 2018 is the 'Jebel Jais Flight' from one of the peaks of the Jebel Jais mountain in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, with a single unbroken span of 2,831.88 metres (9,290.9 ft). The ride has been closed pending the outcome into an investigation into the crash of an Agusta 139 rescue helicopter on 29 December 2018, killing all on board, thought to have clipped one of the cables.

<br><br>
The "Parque de Aventura Barrancas del Cobre" at 2,545 m (8,350 ft) in Copper Canyon, Mexico, was bumped to second place,[32] with "El Monstruo" at Orocovis in Puerto Rico coming in third, at 2,530 m (8,300 ft).

<br><br>
The Skywire at Bluewater in Kent is the longest in England at 725 metres (2,379 ft). The longest zip-line in Europe, at just over 1,600 metres (5,200 ft), is the Zip World Bethesda line in Penrhyn Quarry, Bethesda, Wales. The Zip World Bethesda line also holds the record for being the fastest Zip-Line in the world.
