         <h3>1. Railay Beach</h3>
         <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/THA/thailand-railay-beach.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">

         <p>Krabi province is home to some of Thailand's most famous beach destinations-and Railay tops the list as one of the most stunning. Considered by many as one of the best beaches in the country, Railay delivers on promises of white sand, turquoise-blue water, and the feeling that you've found a slice of paradise even before your feet touch the sand.

<br><br>
The island can be reached by boat from Krabi town and Ao Nang-and the trip on a long-tail traditional boat is just as magical as what you'll encounter when you reach the shores.
            
<br><br>
While the beach might be the main reason to visit the island, Railay is also a rock-climbing hot spot, with karst peaks drawing adventurers both experienced and novice, ready to take on the towering limestone cliffs.
            
<br><br>
Among the many ovther active things to do, Railay is well-known for its ocean rafting and kayaking, snorkeling and scuba diving-but visitors can also try their hand at cooking classes or indulge in a massage.
            
<br><br>
There's also the tourist-friendly Diamond Cave, reached via a beautiful trail with stunning views and ready to accommodate curious visitors looking to do some exploring between stretches of sunbathing.</p>
      </div>
   
      
      <div class="destbox">
         <h3>2. Koh Phi Phi</h3>
         <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2022/06/thailand-best-places-to-visit-koh-phi-phi-boats-on-beach.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">

         <p>The Phi Phi Islands are one of Thailand's most popular resort areas for a reason-the clear blue waters, the soft sand, the breathtaking views that go on forever.

<br><br>
You can reach Phi Phi Don-the largest of the islands and the only one permanently inhabited-on a rented kayak or by hiring a small wooden boat to take you here.
            
<br><br>
Perhaps one of the most fun spots on Koh Phi Phi is Monkey Beach, where you'll come face to face, literally, with plenty of macaques ready to steal your lunch.
        
<br><br>
Long Beach is another nice spot on the island; while not a secluded place where you can hope for privacy, it's great for watching the sunset. If you're lucky and the tide is out, it's a beautiful walk back towards the main part of the island.

<br><br>
Tour operators offer packages for snorkeling and diving trips to the islands, as well as excursions to the famous Maya Bay, where the Leonardo DiCaprio movie The Beach was filmed. Because Koh Phi Phi draws so many tourists, there are plenty of tour companies arranging tickets to other beach destinations, such as Phuket, Koh Chang, and Koh Lanta.
            
<br><br>
Phi Phi Don was one of the areas hit hard by the 2004 tsunami - but since then, guesthouses, restaurants, and markets have been rebuilt, and crowds still come in droves to the resort island. There is a small, somber memorial park to honor those who died in the tragedy, but the resort areas are otherwise revived and looking as beautiful as ever.
            
            </p>

         <h3>3. The Grand Palace, Bangkok</h3>
         <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2022/04/thailand-top-attractions-grand-palace-bangkok-phra-mondop.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">

         <p>Even if your plans for Thailand mainly involve frolicking on a beach and eating as much Massaman curry and pad Thai as humanly possible, you'll probably spend at least a day or two in Bangkok. There are plenty of things to see and do in the capital, but the Grand Palace should definitely be at the top of your list. This is the number one sightseeing attraction in the city, and it's staggering in both historical significance and craftsmanship.

<br><br>
The grounds are a maze of royal halls, temples, and ancient relics, the most important being Wat Phra Kaeo (the Temple of the Emerald Buddha), said to hold a fragment of either hair or bone from the enlightened Buddha himself.
            
<br><br>
Allow several hours to do the Grand Palace justice, but if you're up for more walking afterward, you can easily take in some of the city's other major landmarks nearby. The famous Wat Po and Wat Arun, the Temple of the Dawn (a great place to watch the sunset), are just a few minutes away.</p>
      </div>
   
      
      
      <div class="destbox">
         <h3>4. Sunday Walking Street, Chiang Mai</h3>
         <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/THA/thailand-sunday-walking-street-chiang-mai.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">

         <p>Every Thailand visitor looks forward to cheap and delicious food-and that's exactly what they can find in abundance at Chiang Mai's Sunday Night Walking Street. Vendors sell all kinds of treats here: from the popular pad Thai and chicken satay to samosas, fried bananas, sweet roti, and fresh fruit shakes-often for less than $2 a piece.

<br><br>
Once you've satisfied your culinary cravings, you can peruse hundreds of stalls selling an array of unique goods such as all-natural soaps, hand-dyed textiles bearing the unique patterns of local hill tribes, incense and essential oils, musical instruments, paintings, wall hangings, and more.
            
<br><br>
The market gets crowded every week without fail, no matter what time of the year you're visiting, so brace yourself and try to enjoy being part of the fun chaos. This is one of the must-dos in Chiang Mai, and an essential part of the Thailand experience. If you're not around for the Sunday market, or just want to get a taste of other market experiences in Chiang Mai, check out the Saturday Night Walking Street or the Night Bazaar on Chang Klan Road, a daily event. For something less touristy, head to the daytime Warorot Market, near Mae Ping River.</p>
      </div>

         <h3>5. Pai</h3>
         <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/THA/thailand-pai.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">

         <p>Thailand's reputation as a country of beautiful landscapes and friendly people is due largely to the world-renowned southern beaches. Because of this, most people don't realize that the vast north is also home to entirely different but equally breathtaking places to visit.

<br><br>
Northern Thailand, particularly the western region near the Burmese border, is marked by mountainous jungle terrain that is both rugged and beautiful. Pai, in Mae Hong Son province, is the perfect starting point from which to enjoy the country's natural beauty, as well as the famed Thai hospitality and cooking.
            
<br><br>
This small town has developed a reputation as a mecca for hippies and backpackers, though you will see plenty of families traveling in the area as well. There is a small walking street market that comes alive every night, a variety of local and Western foods, and easy access to nearby Buddhist temples, waterfalls, and the impressive Pai canyon.
<br><br>
            
            There is an air of cheerfulness and relaxation as you walk through the tiny town center, a vibe that continues to draw crowds season after season despite its somewhat remote location.</p>
      </div>
   
      
      
      <div class="destbox">
         <h3>6. Wild Elephants at Khao Yai National Park</h3>
         <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/THA/thailand-khao-yai-national-park.jpg1" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">

         <p>Elephants are revered in Thailand, and statues and paintings of them can be seen everywhere you go, including the royal palaces and many temples. For the ultimate experience, however, nothing beats the chance to see elephants in their natural environment-and Khao Yai National Park provides a great opportunity to do just that.

<br><br>
Here, you'll run into elephants roaming near rivers, exotic birds of prey, monkeys, and plenty of other tropical creatures that call the park home. The park is also home to many waterfalls, including the 150-meter-tall Haew Narok and the even more famous Haew Suwat, which appeared in the Leonardo DiCaprio's film, The Beach.
            
<br><br>
If a one-day stay isn't enough to take it all in, it's possible to camp out at the park and get up early enough to watch the sunrise over the lush landscape.</p>
      </div>
   
      
      
      <div class="destbox">
         <h3>7. Sukhothai Old City</h3>
         <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2022/04/thailand-top-attractions-sukhothai-old-city-water-lilies.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">

         <p>A favorite stop for history buffs and photography enthusiasts, Sukhothai offers many lovely photo ops at a smaller scale than Ayutthaya. Ruins of this old city still stand proud despite enduring centuries of battle and exposure to the elements. Sukhothai's Old City is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and much has been invested to restore and preserve one of Thailand's most significant historical sites.

<br><br>
Of the many wats in Sukhothai, Wat Mahathat is the most impressive. Founded sometime in the 13th century, the temple was built to enshrine Buddha relics and is surrounded by massive standing Buddha images, stuccoed sculptures, stupas, and more.</p>
      </div>
   
      
      
      <div class="destbox">
         <h3>8. Historic City of Ayutthaya</h3>
         <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2022/04/thailand-top-attractions-historic-city-ayutthaya.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">

         <p>Ayutthaya offers a magnificent peek into the glory of ancient Thailand, where visitors can wander the haunting but romantic ruins of the former capital.

<br><br>
Ayutthaya was once the most important city in Thailand, and the old palaces and temples stand as a testament to this. Over a hundred wats, chedis (Thai-style stupas), prangs, and thousands of Buddha statues are spread around the park. Some sights - like the temple that houses the 12-meter-long reclining Buddha and the tree roots embracing a Buddha head - are particularly stunning and not to be missed.
            
<br><br>
Ayutthaya is located only a short bus trip or train ride from Bangkok, making it convenient for a day trip if you're pressed for time. If you're on a more leisurely schedule, plan on spending a few days exploring the ancient capital and rent a push-bike to tour both the old city and the new.</p>
      </div>
   
      
      
      <div class="destbox">
         <h3>9. Beaches of Koh Samui</h3>
         <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2022/06/thailand-best-places-to-visit-koh-samui-beaches-swing-1.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">

         <p>Koh Samui island is the country's second-largest island and home to some of the most beautiful golden coastline you'll find in Southeast Asia. Each beach on Koh Samui offers something different: some are ideal for peaceful isolation; others are filled with activities, water sports, and big crowds.

<br><br>
The island's biggest and busiest beach is Chaweng, where you'll also find the best shopping, plenty of attractions, and some of the nicest restaurants. The turquoise blue waters and palm trees dancing in the ocean breeze might explain why some of the island's best resorts are located here.
            
<br><br>
Heading just south of Chaweng Beach will get you to Lamai Beach, a little smaller and slightly more affordable but still busy in the middle of the day, as day-trippers arrive.
        
<br><br>
For backpackers and those on a budget, there's Maenam Beach, while Bophut Beach (better known as "the Fisherman's Village") is a great destination for visitors wanting a place that retains some traditional Thai touches. At Bophut, that means wooden Thai-Chinese shophouses sitting close to boutique hotels and plenty of attractions.

<br><br>
If you have privacy in mind, the 250-meter-long Silver Beach is somewhat hidden behind forested hills and offers beautiful open views over the water, and excellent snorkeling. Bang Po on the northwest coast is another quiet beach that sees fewer visitors.</p>
      </div>
   
      
      
      <div class="destbox">
         <h3>10. Doi Suthep</h3>
         <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2022/04/thailand-top-attractions-doi-suthep.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">

<br><br>
<p>Perhaps the best-known wat in Chiang Mai sits atop Doi Suthep, a mountain overlooking Thailand's second-largest city. A favorite destination of devout Buddhist followers and travelers from all over the world, Doi Suthep is a marvel of intricate religious carvings - a visit here means seeing monks praying, witnessing worship rituals, and a chance to gaze out over the ever-growing sprawl of Chiang Mai city.

<br><br>
Just be sure to bring a bottle of water and your walking shoes - you'll have to climb a steep staircase to reach the top of the hill where the temple is. At the base of the stairs, vendors hawk everything from tasty local treats to goods handmade by villagers from the surrounding mountains. There's also a shop selling masks, elephant carvings, and home furnishings, so you can do some shopping while recovering from the trek up and down the stairs.
            
<br><br>
You can combine your trip to Doi Suthep with excursions to Doi Pui, a small Hmong village in the mountains. Although far more touristy than other villages, this will still give you a taste of Hmong culture and a chance to learn more about the hill tribe communities in the region, not to mention purchase some beautiful hand-woven textiles. The Bhubing Palace, open to tourists, is on the way to Doi Pui from Doi Suthep as well.</p>
      </div>
   
      
      
      <div class="destbox">
         <h3>11. Climbing at Tonsai Beach</h3>
         <img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/10/thailand-top-attractions-climbing-tonsai-beach.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">

         <p>With its stunning limestone cliffs hugging sandy coastlines and turquoise waters, Thailand attracts plenty of climbers all year long - and while there are many destinations that offer stunning routes, Tonsai Beach has long been considered a climbers' paradise. One of the great things about climbing here is that you can just as easily climb solo or find a climbing partner or club once you arrive - and if you need a refresher lesson, that won't be a problem to find here either.
<br><br>
            Because the area has many climbing and bouldering schools, the easier routes are often busy, and you might even have to queue to get up to the most popular viewpoints. If you're an experienced climber - and can get around stalactites, overhangs, and tufa - you'll fare much better and get the best spots with stunning open views over the bay (almost) all to yourself.</p>
