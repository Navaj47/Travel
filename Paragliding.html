         <p>Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

<br><br>
Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.</p>

         
                    
            
            <h3>Popular Places For Paragliding</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Interlaken, Switzerland</h4>
            <img src="https://cf.bstatic.com/data/xphoto/1182x887/318/31829876.jpg?size=S" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>Straddling glacier-fed lakes and capped by snow-dusted mountains, Interlaken is the gateway to Switzerland's famous Jungfrau region. This is arguably Europe’s most enticing adventure playground, and gliding weightlessly above the numerable 4,000-metre summits is one of its biggest draws. Back on the ground, recharge your batteries in the luxurious pools and health spa of Victoria Jungfrau Grand Hotel & Spa.</p>
 
            
            <h4>2. Pokhara, Nepal</h4>

            <p>With staggering views of the world’s tallest mountains, paragliding in Nepal’s Pokhara Valley is grade-A bucket list material. The comparably low altitude means temperatures stay warm, causing more rising thermals that help you get the best views of the Annapurna and Himalayan mountain ranges. The take-off spot is the hilly village of Sarangkot, but for a room with an unforgettable view, head to top-rated Hotel White Pearl. It sits beside Phewa Lake – famed for its crystal-clear mountain reflections.</p>


            <h4>3. San Gil, Colombia</h4>
            <img src="https://cf.bstatic.com/data/xphoto/1182x887/318/31829882.jpg?size=S" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>Adrenaline lovers flock to San Gil, determined to make the most of the fast-flowing rivers, cliff edges and bottomless ravines in the area. Paragliding the epic Chicamocha Canyon is the main attraction, with the chance to fly up to 1,500 metres amidst breathtaking scenery. The helpful hosts at budget-friendly Bacaregua Hostel will gladly arrange your trip, and provide plenty of other recommendations.</p>

            
            <h4>4. Oludeniz, Turkey</h4>
            <img src="https://cf.bstatic.com/data/xphoto/1182x887/318/31829892.jpg?size=S" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>For postcard-worthy shorelines, the bay of Oludeniz may well be the best in the Mediterranean. You’ve only to strap into a glider and leap from the top of Mount Babadağ to see why. Stark white sands contrast sharply with the Med’s terrific blue-green hues, while the verdant Taurus mountains stretch to the horizon. After all that excitement, catch your breath at Jade Residence, a beachside hotel where you can watch other daredevils take to the skies.</p>

            <h4>5. Valle de Bravo, Mexico</h4>
            <img src="https://cf.bstatic.com/data/xphoto/1182x887/318/31829875.jpg?size=S" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>Valle de Bravo is not only Mexico’s top spot for paragliding, but is internationally renowned for its consistently reliable conditions created by low wind pressure. There are two main flying locations, La Torre and El Peñón. The former is a ridge-soaring site 30 minutes from town by car, while the latter is better suited to advanced pilots who want to fly long distances. Wind down in El Santuario Resort & Spa for superb lakeside views and lavish spa facilities.</p>

            <h4>6. Canoa Quebrada, Brazil</h4>
            <img src="https://cf.bstatic.com/data/xphoto/1182x887/318/31829878.jpg?size=S" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>Canoa Quebrada’s looming sandstone cliffs make it the ideal destination to get some wind under your sails – or canopy, to use the technical term. The beach offers optimal conditions for paragliding, with strong winds blowing through all year round. You could even take it up a notch by trying out ‘para-motoring’ – paragliding with a small motor attached – or just sit back with a caipirinha at Hotel & Pousada Tatajuba and watch other aviators glide by your private balcony.</p>

            <h4>7. Gudauri, Georgia</h4>
            <img src="https://cf.bstatic.com/data/xphoto/1182x887/318/31829871.jpg?size=S" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>Soaring over pearly white peaks as skiers whiz below isn’t what you’d call conventional paragliding, but that’s how it’s done in Gudauri. Tandem flights are available throughout the year here, treating thrill-seekers to spectacular views over the ridges of the Stepantsminda and Aragvi valleys. Base yourself in the deluxe Tsar Bani Spa Resort for maximum comfort, top spa facilities and beautiful mountain views.
