         <p>Parachuting, including also skydiving, is a method of transiting from a high point in the atmosphere to the surface of Earth with the aid of gravity, involving the control of speed during the descent using a parachute or parachutes.

                <br><br>
                For human skydiving, it may involve a phase of more or less free-falling (the skydiving segment) which is a period when the parachute has not yet been deployed and the body gradually accelerates to terminal velocity.
            
                <br><br>
                For cargo parachuting, the parachute descent may begin immediately, such as a parachute-airdrop in the lower atmosphere of Earth, or be significantly delayed, such as in a planetary atmosphere where an object is descending "under parachute" following atmospheric entry from space, and may begin only after the hypersonic entry phase and initial deceleration that occurs due to friction with the thin upper atmosphere.</p>

            <img src="https://www.everestskydive.com/images/2020/08/14/banner3.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>Take the leap of a lifetime as you jump out of a plane with your tandem instructor or go for a free fall from Mount Everest if you are a daredevil. This is not only the highest drop zone in the world, but also the most scenic, courtesy the views of the mighty Himalayas. An altitude of 29,500 feet makes it all the more thrilling and difficult to achieve. 

                <br><br>
                There are only four skydiving trips operated from the Mount Everest in a year and it’s also the most expensive. If you want to feel an adrenaline high like never before and jump from the highest peak in the world, make sure you book at least six months in advance.
                <br><br>
                Best Time to Go: October is when the four jumps are organised. Dates may vary. Check out http://www.everest-skydive.com/ for more details
