         <p>A Flyboard is a brand of hydroflighting device which supplies propulsion to drive the Flyboard into the air to perform a sport known as hydroflying.

                <br><br>
                A Flyboard rider stands on a board connected by a long hose to a watercraft. Water is forced under pressure to a pair of boots with jet nozzles underneath which provide thrust for the rider to fly up to 22 m (72 ft) in the air or to dive headlong through the water down as far as one is willing to go.
        
                <br><br>
                Basically, it is a platform attached to boots that are connected to the turbine of a jet ski which rises in the air allowing you to perform different freestyle tricks. Soar to heights of up to 12 meters and some pros even go up to 20m! During the Flyboard session, the instructor stays on the jet ski to control the engine throttle and regulate your power and height.
                <br><br>
                From the moment you find a big body of water, whether a lake or an ocean, you can practice Flyboard and Hoverboard. Our selection is based on the quality of service and the reputation of the school, while also focusing on the exceptional panoramic which will surround you.
