         <p>Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience.

                <br><br>
                This activity as an adventure sport has become popular since the 1950s, if not earlier, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet (3.0 m) to 14 feet (4.3 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern, or by the use of oars.
            
                <br><br>
                Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be fatal, while other sections are not so extreme or difficult. Rafting is also a competitive sport practiced around the world which culminates in a world rafting championship event between the participating nations. The International Rafting Federation, often referred to as the IRF, is the worldwide body which oversees all aspects of the sport.

         <b>   Equipment</b>

                <br><br>
                Rafting equipment has continuously evolved and developed significantly from old rubber WW II era military surplus rafts. Modern whitewater rafts are typically made with advanced nylon or Kevlar infused plastics like PVC or urethane; though many of the more entry-level low-cost manufacturers still use a glued rubber. Plastic is generally more durable, longer-lasting, and just as easy to repair compared to older rubber rafts.[4]
            
                <br><br>
                Paddles and oars are the typical means of propulsion for rafts and come in many sizes and varieties with specific river conditions in mind.</p>

         
                    
            
            <h3>Popular Places For Rafting</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Zambezi River, Zimbabwe</h4>
            <img src="https://www.team4adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zambezi.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>Zambezi River in Africa is one of a kind experience. This river starts below the 110 feet tall mesmerizing Victoria Falls and offers around 23 rapids in a 15 mile long stretch. One of the reasons it is called the “wildest one day whitewater run in the world.” The other reason for it being referred to as wild is the wildlife itself. Tourists at times spot hippos, elephants and crocodiles. It is a high volume, pool and drop style river with some really turbulent sections.

                <br><br>
                It is classified as a Class V river for obvious reasons. Few of its rapids are named as commercial suicide, gnashing jaws of death and the terminator. All these things when combined together make this river as one of the best rafting destinations in the world.</p>
 
            
            <h4>2. Colorado River, USA</h4>
            <img src="https://www.team4adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/colorado.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>Colorado River offers the best rafting experience in North America. The desert like surroundings can be deceptive, as the river that cuts through the canyons is completely untamed. Colorado plunges through the canyons of Utah and Arizona, carving its way beautifully through steep gorges and 5 national parks. Although even a single day rafting trip can be fun filled, the real adventure comes with multi day trips on the mighty Colorado River. For getting a booking on the multi day trips, you would need to sign up well in advance owing to the small number of operators.</p>


            <h4>3. Middle Fork, Salmon River, USA</h4>
            <img src="https://www.team4adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/middlefork.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>This one is a classic 100 mile stretch of pure happiness. It surely finds its way on our list of the best rafting destinations in the world. Carving its way through the imposing canyons and dense alpine forests, this river is a beaut. The warm side streams, waterfalls, unending wilderness and the continuous stretch of whitewater makes this trip a must try.
                <br><br>

                The water levels are high during the early part of the season and gradually mellow down towards August. This 100 mile trip is a splendid multi day rafting trip amidst the most sought for wilderness in America.
                
                </p>

            
            <h4>4. North Johnstone River, Australia</h4>
            <img src="https://www.team4adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/australia.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>Talking about remote places, this river is pretty remote. For starters, you need to board a helicopter to reach the put in spot, which is right in the heart of a dense rainforest. This is a 4 – 6 day long river expedition with rapids touching the grade V difficulty level. The season for rafting the Johnstone is short. There are no dams on this river and the flows depend on the rains.

                <br><br>
                The highlight of this rafting trip is not just the splendid whitewater but the extensive flaura and fauna which even contains the rarest of pre-historic species. It is an unmatched rafting experience and definitely Australia’s most challenging whitewater section.</p>

            <h4>5. Brahmaputra River, India – One of the top remote rafting destinations</h4>
            <img src="https://www.team4adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/brahmaputra.jpg" alt="background not found" class="adventureimg">
            <p>The Brahmaputra is one of the biggest rivers on the planet. Originating from Tibet, this river passes through Northeast India, where its volume is at the highest. It is a majestic Class IV – V section with some giant waves. The river passes through India’s remotest terrains, pristine beaches and dense forests. The inhabitants of the surrounding places are animists, so if you spot some tribal carrying a weapon, don’t be surprised, they’re probably hunting their next meal.

                <br><br>
                The Brahmaputra Rafting Expedition or Siang Rafting Expedition spans across a period of 9-10 days. The grandeur of the river and solitude of the surroundings is an experience that shall last in your memories forever.
                <br><br>
                This list can be endless. The number of rafting options available out there is way too many. Each river imparts its own unique charm to the landscape. Some rivers might be steep, whereas the others might have a lesser gradient but bigger waves. Nonetheless, whatever the gradient or landscape, the one thing that is certain is the sheer joy you would experience by the end of it.</p>
