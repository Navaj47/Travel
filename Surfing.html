         <p>Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.

<br><br>
The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
            
<br><br>
Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is caught and ridden using the surfer's own body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some surfers to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand.
            
<br><br>
Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of wave that is ridden.</p>

            <p>This natural marvel host the record-breaking 100-foot wave ever surfed. Extreme surfer Garrett McNamara made headlines a few years ago (2011) for balancing himself on a 100-foot wall of water. This was made possible primarily due to the 16,000 feet undersea canyon that points downward like an arrow. The wave although was triggered as an aftereffect of a huge storm off the coast of Ireland. But yes, this means exponentially heavy wipeouts if circumstances turn unfortunate. The big waves at Nazare are no doubt only for the most skilful and daring of surfers.

            <p>Hoddevik is one of those places that demand a thick wetsuit.

            <p>South Africa is a surfer's paradise in general. However, Jeffery's Bay could just as well take the medal for being the best. The bay features some of the most brilliant right-hand breaks you can ever witness. The wave is separated into several individual sections across varying levels, as many as ten sometimes. If you're an advanced surfer, head over to the supertube. It's great fun and also ever so dangerous.

            <p>Canggu was nothing but a black-sand beach filled to the edge with rice paddies just a decade back. Canggu did, however, have a fantastic reef break which intermediate surfers used to exploit to train mercilessly. The wave is the same, but Canggu has changed now to sport a vibrant cafe vibe throughout the beach town encouraging a hip lifestyle. This is the perfect surf spot to go with friends.
